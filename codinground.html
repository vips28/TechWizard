Q1.  Alice and Bob are playing a game with a (N+1)×(M+1)(N+1)×(M+1) table. Let's denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column (0≤i≤N, 0≤j≤M) by (i,j). The rules of the game are:
At the beginning, a stone is placed in some cell of the table.
The players alternate turns, Alice goes first.
In each turn, the current player must move the stone from its current cell (let's denote it by (x,y)) to the cell (x−1,y) or to the cell (x,y−1).
As soon as the stone is placed in a cell (x,y) with x=0or y=0, the game ends.
The winner of the game is determined by the cell the stone ended up in and the player who moved it there; you are given this information for all possible terminal cells on the input. (Note that the stone never reaches the cell (0,0).)
You should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given the initial position (x,y) of the stone, and you should determine the winner of the game.

Input
<br>
<p>
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string with length M. For each ii (1≤i≤M), the i-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (0,i) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.
The second line contains a single string with length N. For each ii (1≤i≤N), the i-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (i,0) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.
The third line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the following QQ lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing one query.
</p>
<br>
Output<br><p>
For each test case, print a single line containing a string with length Q. For each valid i, the i-th digit should be '1' if Alice wins the game for query ii or '0' if Bob wins that game.</p>

Q2.  Lower Bound-STL In C++
 <br><p>
Logic:- So basically is this Lower Bound-STL(Lower bound is a function that can be used with a sorted vector.) problem an array is given and number of query Q(an integer) is given we have to find that if a Query is present in an array then program returns an index of a number with "Yes" without quotes and if the query is not present then it should return "No" without quotes and also number greater than query. If you do not get don't worry I am here let's take an example.
</p><br>
Explanation:-
 <br>
Sample Input
 <br>
 8                          // Array Size
 1 1 2 2 6 9 9 15  // Array elements
 4                         // Number of Query
 1                         // Query 1
 4                         // Query 2
 9                         // Query 3
 15                        // Query 4
 
Sample Output
 
 Yes 1
 No 5
 Yes 6
 Yes 8
 
So according to first query 1 is present in an index 1 so our output is Yes 1, Now move on to second query 4 is not present in array that's why the output is No 5, according to condition if number is not present in an array then it should return a next greater number than query. Now next query is 9 it is present in an index 6 so the output is Yes 6. and the last query is 15 it is also present in an array that's why the output is Yes 8.
 
Note:- Here an array index is starting with 1, Normally start with 0.

Q3.  Generics In C++
Task:- Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

Note: You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.

Input Format

The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your printArray function.

Constraints

You must have exactly 1 function named printArray.

Output Format

Your printArray function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.

Explanation:- We have to just print the generic array, we can do this by using the AUTO keyword in our program. I didn't understand why people don't use AUTO Keyword in C++. as you can see that generic array means all type of data type in an array so for that this is a best practice to use the AUTO keyword in the problem.

 
Q4.  Print all natural numbers upto N without using semi-colon.
We use the idea of recursively calling main function.


Q5. find sum of two integers without using ‘+’ operator. 
 

Q6. Implement Queue using Linked List

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.
Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the queue is empty else the element poped out from the queue . 
You are required to complete the two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the quee  and pop which returns a integer poped out from other queue.
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take inputs. Just complete the provided functions.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100
Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2   
Output:
2 3
Explanation:
Testcase1:
1 2    the quee will be {2}
1 3    the queue will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 2 the queue will be {3}
1 4    the queue will be {3 4}
2       poped element will be 3 


Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
/*Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above.*/

Q10. Given two force vectors, find out whether they are parallel, perpendicular or neither. Let the first vector be A = a1 i +a2 j + a3 k and the second vector be B = b1 i + b2 j + b3 k.
A.B = a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3
A x B = (a2*b3 - a3*b2) i - (a1*b3 - b1*a3) j + (a1*b2 - a2*b1) k
|A|^2 = a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2
If A.B = 0, then A and B are perpendicular.
If |A X B|^2 = 0, then A and B are parallel.
Input:
The first line of input takes the number of test cases, T. Then T test cases follow. For each test case there will be two lines. The first line contains 3 space separated integers representing the components of the first force vector in x, y and z directions.
